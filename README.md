# obsidian-workout-log

Run "Exercise Seperator.py", and markdown files for each exercise get generated in "/Exercises". If it doesn't work, you may need to change the input and output file paths.

Forked from BugBoysWorld and would not be possible without his wonderful YouTube tutorial guide.

 This Obsidian repository will allow you to track your exercise/training workouts. 
 
 templates/exercise_log.md
 - modify to add your own exercises for the drop down list
 
 Enhancement List
 - ~~automate the autonumber~~ Added HH*mm*ss to file names, effectively preventing duplicates
 - create summary pages for weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual
 - ~~format/style the dataview tables~~ Added tables for each workout sorted by date, descending(i.e. most recent file is at the top)
 - show previous workout for the same day of the week.
 - ~~remove the need to add zeros for items that are not used~~(**MAYBE**) Removed "time" property from exercises.
 - link exercise name to a video demostration
 - dynamically change the "/Exercise" files?? I doubt that's possible in obsidian.
 - execute the python script from obsidian.
 - automatically identify and convert from imperial to metric.
